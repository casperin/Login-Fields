Use as you please.


This is a method for creating a minimal login form with the following abilities:

  * Labels inside the input fields (as default value)
  * Shows "password" in the password box and not stars, dots or whatever
  * Label disappears on focus
  * Labels are different from whatever is typed into the fields (in the example
    it's grayed out)
  * Still allows users without js to login without too much hazzle
